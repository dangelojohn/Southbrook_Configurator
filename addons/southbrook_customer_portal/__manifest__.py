Southbrook Customer Portal (Module 8 — Phase 1)
================================================

Extends Odoo's portal module with the customer-facing kitchen-project
review experience.

Routes:
  GET  /my/kitchen-projects                — list customer's projects
  GET  /my/kitchen-project/<id>            — review the A/B/C concepts
  POST /my/kitchen-project/<id>/select/<option_id>   — pick an option
  POST /my/kitchen-project/<id>/approve    — final customer approval

Approval wiring:
  Selecting an option flips sb.kitchen.design.option.is_selected
  (Module 5 one-of-N enforcement).
  Approving creates an sb.kitchen.approval (approver_type=customer)
  and advances the project state via action_customer_approves().

ACL discipline (init-doc):
  Public ACL boundary tested as anonymous SECOND customer. A customer
  must NEVER see another customer's project. Record rule on
  sb.kitchen.project: visible to a portal user only when partner_id
  matches their res.users.partner_id.

Three.js KitchenCanvas (Phase 2):
  The init-doc Module 8 calls for a Three.js live preview of the
  Configuration Engine output. That's a substantial OWL frontend
  deliverable; Phase 1 ships server-rendered QWeb option cards so the
  approval flow works end-to-end. KitchenCanvas plugs in via an extra
  template later — no model changes.

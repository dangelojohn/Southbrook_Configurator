        a `[lo, hi]` list is genuinely ambiguous (what does a single-element
        or three-element list mean?), whereas the `{"min":, "max":}` dict
        the range branch below already expects says exactly what it means.
        Callers that don't pass `category` (there is one: the domain-builder
        unit tests, which exercise `_facet_domain` directly without going
        through `get_catalog`) simply skip this check — the direct-call path
        has no category to resolve declarations against, and everything

        it was opened from never disagree about which specs exist.

        Values share the absence rule with _rows() via _normalize_value —

        (one extra query, same _null_mask helper) so a numeric spec can
        never render 0 here for a row that showed a dash, or vice versa.

        Access: get_catalog's scope check is incidental — it only happens
        because _build_payload always calls _categories(), which searches
        southbrook.tool.category (readable only by group_tool_operator and
        friends). _build_detail has no equivalent forced touch:
        _columns(category) short-circuits to the generic columns whenever
        `category` is falsy, so a product with NO
        x_southbrook_tool_category_id set never reaches that model at all,
        and a base.group_user-only account could otherwise call get_detail
        directly and read title/specs/badges/engineering with no gate.
        Enforce the same scope check unconditionally, before any data is
        assembled, rather than relying on it happening to fire.

        Scope: this is a TOOLS-catalog endpoint. A product with no tool
        category at all (its own `x_southbrook_tool_category_id` is unset)
        is out of scope even though it may still exist and be perfectly
        readable through other models — degrade rather than serve vendor,
        stock and lifecycle data for a product the tools catalog was never
        meant to describe. Without this check, ENGINEERING_FIELDS was read
        unconditionally regardless of category, so any product id in the
        database — not just tools — returned a fully populated engineering
        rail; only the (correctly empty) spec grid hinted anything was
        scoped at all.

        Archived: `browse()`/`exists()` both ignore the `active` flag, so
        an archived product still satisfies `exists()` even though
        get_catalog's own `search()`-based listing (which does respect
        `active`) would never surface it again. A stale link to a

        """One field's value, read()-shaped, normalized, relation-resolved.

        `data` came from a batched tmpl.read(); a many2one there is Odoo's
        (id, display_name) tuple. Tuple-unwrapping and the absence rule
        both live in _normalize_value — the same helper _rows() uses for
        its cells — so a relation column can never render
        differently in the table than in this detail panel.

        `nulls` is this template's slice of _null_mask() — {key: True} for
        every numeric column that is genuinely SQL NULL. Defaults to {} so
        an unfiltered caller (there is none left, but the default keeps this
        method safe to call standalone) falls back to "nothing known null".
        """
        field = tmpl._fields.get(key)

        is_null = (nulls or {}).get(key, False)
        return _normalize_value(raw, field, is_null=is_null)

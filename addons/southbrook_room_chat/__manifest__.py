Southbrook Room Chat
=====================

A customer chats with an AI (a vision-capable Claude model, Sonnet 5 — the
same model already used by southbrook_room_capture) describing their kitchen
room: shape, wall lengths, doors, windows. Each turn, the AI calls tools that
build up a DRAFT room geometry — it never creates southbrook.room / .wall /
.constraint records directly. The draft is shown live next to the chat via a
reused preview panel, and a "finish in Room Setup" action hands the draft to
the EXISTING "Set Up Your Room" wizard (southbrook_estimating_website's
RoomSetupWizard) for mandatory human review, exactly like the sibling
southbrook_room_capture (photo-based) addon. Every geometry value still
passes through southbrook.room.validate_geometry before persistence, whether
it arrived by chat, photo, or manual entry — this addon adds no new
persistence path onto the core room models.

Components:
* southbrook.room.chat.session — persists the per-order conversation draft
  (a plain JSON blob, in the same shape southbrook_room_capture's
  `_estimate_to_existing_room` already produces) and a lightweight text
  transcript, so a conversation can resume across page loads.
* southbrook.room.chat.agent (AbstractModel) — builds the Anthropic tools
  request, runs the tool_use loop (set_room_shape, add_wall, update_wall,
  remove_wall, add_constraint, remove_constraint,
  validate_current_draft), and normalizes the reply. Mock mode (the
  default) returns a canned scripted reply so cold installs and CI never
  touch the network.
* controllers/main.py — one JSON-RPC route:
  POST /southbrook/api/order/<id>/room/chat.

Frontend: a "Chat to build your room" panel on the Order Builder page (a
new RoomChatWidget, mirroring southbrook_hermes's chat widget pattern),
showing the draft filling in live via a reused RoomOutlinePreview. A
"Looks good — finish in Room Setup" button hands the draft to the existing
wizard via the same idless-prefill path southbrook_room_capture already
established (no wizard code changes needed beyond exporting
RoomOutlinePreview for reuse).

"""sale.order — Premium Orchestration spine activation.

Phase 1.1 of the Premium MRP Orchestration addon. Closes the gap discovered
in production: of the 9 confirmed sale.orders on https://southbrookcabinetry.space,
only 1 actually spawned its project.task spine; the other 8 booked MOs directly
with project_task_id=False — breaking the "Project as Manufacturing PM hub"
promise the southbrook_project / southbrook_project_mrp / southbrook_mrp_pm
stack was built to deliver.

This module:
  1. Overrides ``action_confirm`` to ALWAYS create the project.task spine for
     kitchen-cabinet orders (in addition to / instead of the legacy
     ``_southbrook_ensure_job`` path in southbrook_project_mrp, which is too
     conservative — it skips orders whose products don't yet have a BoM).
  2. Backlinks any orphan mrp.production records whose ``origin`` matches the
     order name but whose ``project_task_id`` is still False.
  3. Exposes a server-action callable ``action_backfill_kitchen_task`` that is
     idempotent and safe to fire from the UI for the 8 known orphan orders.
  4. Stamps ``x_premium_orchestration_managed`` once the spine exists, so the
     B2 readiness cron can find unscored orders cheaply.

Defensive-by-design: the project.task model carries ~60 custom fields in
production (x_door_style, x_wood_species, x_finish, install_due_date, …)
that are not declared in any tracked python module — they were added via the
Odoo UI / ir.model.fields in the live DB. We probe with ``_fields`` containment
and skip silently when absent, so this module is installable on a fresh CE
database (e.g. CI) and on the live DB without divergent code paths.

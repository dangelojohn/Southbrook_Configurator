"""project.task — Premium Orchestration readiness cron + telemetry.

Phase 1.1 closes the loop by ensuring the readiness compute that
southbrook_project_mrp already implements actually runs on a schedule
against every open kitchen task.

The actual scoring logic lives in southbrook_project_mrp.project_task —
specifically ``action_recompute_readiness_lines`` (confirmed via grep
across the addon, line 2239 of that file). We don't reimplement it;
this addon only adds:

  1. ``readiness_last_recomputed_at`` — a Datetime stamp on the task,
     so the dashboard view in views/kitchen_jobs_views.xml can sort
     "most stale" first.
  2. ``_cron_recompute_readiness_all`` — an @api.model entry point the
     ir.cron in data/ir_cron.xml fires every 15 minutes. Picks all
     open kitchen tasks (linked to a sale.order and not in a closed
     state) and triggers the recompute; if the readiness_decision
     flips between runs, drops a chatter note on the task.

Defensive symmetry with sale_order.py: we look up the readiness
compute method via getattr() rather than direct call, so the addon
remains installable if a future southbrook_project_mrp release renames
the public method. Both common spellings (``action_recompute_readiness``
and the v19-shipped ``action_recompute_readiness_lines``) are probed.

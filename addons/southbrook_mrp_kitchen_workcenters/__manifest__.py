Southbrook Kitchen Work Centers
================================

Extends the Southbrook MRP stack with kitchen-cabinet-specific work-center
configuration, master data (materials / finishes / skills), and a station-type
taxonomy that lets operation templates and routing decisions reason about
the shop floor in the same vocabulary a planner uses.

Phase M1 ships:
  * Master data — Materials (10) + Finishes (9) lightweight CE-safe models
  * mrp.workcenter extension with x_sbk_* configuration fields:
    station_type, machine_code, machine_brand, supported_material_ids,
    supported_finish_ids, required_skill_ids (reuses hr.skill),
    max_panel_length_mm / width_mm, default_setup_time_min,
    changeover_time_min, allows_parallel_jobs, is_bottleneck,
    oee_target, planning_notes, shop_floor_notes, quality_notes,
    active_for_kitchen
  * 2 new work centers seeded — ENG01 (Design Review / Production
    Engineering) and CNC02 (Backup CNC Router)
  * station_type assigned to the 12 existing Southbrook work centers
    via no-noupdate post-load applies

Subsequent phases (M2-M4) layer in operation templates with dynamic
duration formulas, quality + rework + downtime, project/room/cabinet
fields on mrp.production, costing extensions, demo data, and views.

Built strictly for Odoo 19 CE — no Enterprise dependencies. Extends
existing Southbrook modules (southbrook_kitchen_mrp,
southbrook_manufacturing_intelligence, southbrook_mrp_pm,
southbrook_kitchen_workspace) without duplicating their models.

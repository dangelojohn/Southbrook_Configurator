"""southbrook.capacity.day — calendar-aware capacity row per (WC, day).

W067 (R3.10, 2026-06-27)
========================

The legacy Capacity pivot (southbrook_mrp_pm.views/pm_capacity.xml) shows
`SUM(mrp.workorder.duration_expected)` per (workcenter, day) and asks the
PM to mentally compare against an 8h shift. That's wrong on any work
center with a non-default `resource_calendar_id` (4-day weeks, holidays,
2-shift CNC) — the headroom calc is OFF for the WCs that need it most.

This model surfaces the corrected denominator: a stored row per
(workcenter × day in window) carrying `available_minutes` derived from
the WC's own `resource_calendar_id.get_work_hours_count(start, end)`,
PLUS `loaded_minutes` summed from in-flight WO duration_expected, so
the pivot can plot real headroom.

JTBD: "When a WC has a 4-day Monday holiday, I want the capacity pivot
to know that and not show false headroom."

Refresh model:
- Daily cron at 02:30 rebuilds the next 14 days for all active WCs.
- "Refresh Calendar Capacity" server action lets the planner force a
  rebuild after editing a calendar / declaring a holiday.

The model is intentionally a simple snapshot — we don't try to be a
live calendar engine. Stale-by-design (≤24h or until next refresh).

NO raw SQL per spec constraint. All ORM.

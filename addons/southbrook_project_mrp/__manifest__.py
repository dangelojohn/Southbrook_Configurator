Southbrook Project ↔ Manufacturing
==================================

The job/coordination layer ABOVE the MRP backbone — it does NOT rebuild any
manufacturing logic (BoMs, work orders, routings, costing all stay in mrp).

* T1.1  Link  — project.task.production_ids <-> mrp.production.project_task_id
        (a customer job spans several MOs: base + worktop + pantry…). MO
        number(s), product/SKU and BoM surface on the task.
* T1.2  Status — read-only computed roll-up on the task, sourced from mrp/stock:
        each MO's state + component availability (reservation_state), MO refs,
        and a cost roll-up pulled from the costing fields when present. Lets the
        PM answer "can we build this, and where is it?" from the job.
* T1.3  Flow  — confirming a sale auto-creates/links the project.task job and
        attaches its MOs (also linked at MO-creation time, since procurement
        may create MOs after confirmation).

Reuses the custom MO tabs (CAD / Intelligence / Production Costs / Shop Floor)
rather than duplicating them — material/BoM/cost are pulled FROM the linked MO.

"""
sale.order extension — channel-to-pricelist resolution dispatcher.

This file IS custom routine #3 per Build Spec section 4. Adding any
business logic beyond _resolve_channel_pricelist requires PUNCHLIST
justification.

The dispatcher reads partner.channel (and partner.tradesperson_tier
when applicable) and returns the matching pricelist record. Called
from a default-getter on pricelist_id so the user can still manually
override the resolved pricelist post-creation.

NF5 behaviour: when channel=tradesperson and tier is null, returns
the base pricelist_tradesperson (cost+5% floor, no tier discount).
A soft warning is logged (not raised) so order creation isn't
blocked but the operations team is alerted.

    # QA Bug 1 fix (2026-07-04): action_config_start (product_configurator_
    # sale/models/sale.py) launches the "Configure Product" wizard for a
    # brand-new order line with allow_preset_selection=True hardcoded into
    # its own context dict — with_context() can't override that, since the
    # base method rebuilds the dict itself and always wins. That flag
    # forces an always-empty "Preset" field onto the same "Select
    # Template" screen where no template has been chosen yet (its domain
    # is [('product_tmpl_id', '=', product_tmpl_id)], guaranteed empty
    # while product_tmpl_id is unset) — very likely why testers never
    # notice/use the (already-working) template picker before clicking
    # Next, which then hits product.config.session's product_tmpl_id
    # NOT NULL constraint on Odoo's implicit pre-button-call save,
    # surfacing as a raw, uncaught ValidationError.
    #
    # Presets only make sense once a template is already known — the
    # OTHER two entry points (reconfigure_product on sale.order.line, and
    # product.template.configure_product) are for an EXISTING line/
    # product and correctly leave preset selection available. For a
    # brand-new line there's nothing to preset from yet, so this override
    # re-implements action_config_start with just that one flag changed.

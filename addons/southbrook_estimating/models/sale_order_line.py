sale.order.line extension — Q21 zone field.

Per Q21 locked decision (Image Floor case study NF9 confirmation):
6-value selection plus a free-text zone_label that's only visible when
zone='other'. NO separate ORM model — zone is just a field on the line.

The Order Builder view in views/sale_order_views.xml groups lines by zone
via the standard `<group expand="1" string="Zone">` pattern. The
customer-facing spec sheet (Phase 1 QWeb report, custom routine #6)
also groups by zone for the print-out.

    # (product_configurator_sale's reconfigure_product, upstream OCA —
    # not patched in place) always jumps straight past the Select
    # Template step into the first attribute step (Construction &
    # Sizing) via create_config_wizard(click_next=True, the default).
    # That's correct once a line has GENUINE prior config choices to
    # re-open — but a line whose product_id was set WITHOUT ever going
    # through the configurator (config_session_id is False: e.g. a
    # directly-typed-in or demo-seeded line, exactly S01331's shape)
    # has nothing of its own to "re"-configure. Jumping ahead there
    # showed either a blank or an unrelated shared session with no
    # visible way to see/change which template was implied, which QA
    # flagged as confusing.
    #
    # For that specific case only, route through the SAME "start
    # fresh" path product.template.configure_product() already uses
    # (click_next=False, product_tmpl_id_readonly=True) so the wizard
    # lands on Select Template first, same as a genuinely-fresh
    # configure — while leaving the normal re-open-existing-session
    # behavior for lines that DO have config_session_id untouched.
    #
    # Round 2 fix (2026-07-04, live-browser-diagnosed regression): the
    # first attempt still passed product_id in extra_vals (copied from
    # the base reconfigure_product's own extra_vals). That's wrong for
    # THIS branch specifically: ProductConfigurator.get_state_selection()
    # (product_configurator/wizard/product_configurator.py:108) does
    # `steps = open_steps if wiz.product_id else steps + open_steps` --
    # whenever the wizard record has product_id set, "select" is
    # dropped from the statusbar's OWN option list entirely, even
    # though the record's actual state value is still 'select'. Result:
    # the backend was 100% correct (state='select', product_tmpl_id
    # pre-filled) but the statusbar widget had no matching option to
    # highlight, so no step showed as current. configure_product() (the
    # header button, confirmed working) never sets product_id at wizard-
    # creation time, only product_tmpl_id -- mirroring that exactly
    # (dropping product_id here) is the fix. order_line_id is enough
    # for action_config_done to write the final result back to the
    # right line; the final variant is resolved from the wizard's

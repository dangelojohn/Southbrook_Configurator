"""Southbrook Kitchen — pure layout engine.

The single source of truth for *where and how* cabinets sit in a room.

Design contract (P0, 2026-07-11):
  * PURE. No Odoo imports, no ORM, no `self`, no I/O, no globals. Every
    input arrives as plain data; every output is plain data. This module
    must be importable and runnable with a bare `python3`.
  * DETERMINISTIC + STATELESS. Same inputs → same outputs, always. No
    randomness, no clocks, no mutation of the inputs.
  * UI-INDEPENDENT. The engine never knows whether its caller is the
    read-only Preview, the drag editor, an auto-layout pass, an import
    wizard, or a future AI designer. It consumes *semantic* placement
    inputs and emits manufacturable placements.

Domain separation (John, 2026-07-11):
  * Manufacturing domain (`sale.order.line`) = product/qty/price/BOM. NOT
    an input concept here beyond product identity + dimensions.
  * Layout domain (`kitchen.design.line`) = wall, run_seq, offsets,
    rotation, adjacency. THIS is the engine's input.

Evolution path — Cabinet Relationship Graph:
  Today runs are derived from (wall, run_seq). That is deliberately isolated
  in `_resolve_runs()`. Tomorrow, runs come from an adjacency graph
  (connects_to / terminates_into / corner_with / filler_before / ...), and
  walls become just one constraint type. Only `_resolve_runs()` changes;
  the placement mechanics below are graph-agnostic.

Coordinate frame (millimetres, right-handed, matches the existing scene):
  * +X runs along the back wall, left→right.
  * +Z runs from the back wall (z=0) toward the front of the room (z=depth).
  * +Y is up. rotation_deg is a right-handed rotation about +Y.
  * A cabinet's local pose faces the room (out of the back wall) at
    rotation_deg = 0.

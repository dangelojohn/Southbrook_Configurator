Southbrook Estimating
=====================

The sales-rep-facing Order Builder for Southbrook Kitchens on Odoo 19.0
Community Edition, built on top of the OCA product_configurator suite.

This addon ships:

* The Order Builder backend with multi-zone grid (BASE_RUN / WALL /
  TALL / ISLAND / ACCESSORY / OTHER) and "Duplicate as Draft" action
  for iterative-design workflows.
* 11 declarative configurator attributes (plus 3 derived) seeded with
  12 cabinet templates and 65 product.config.line rule records covering
  4 business rules (series-door, box-series, width-doorcount,
  family-softclose).
* 6 channel pricelists (Retail / Dealer / Tradesperson / KD / Big-Box /
  Refacing CTHS) plus 3 tradesperson tier sub-pricelists, dispatched
  via class-level tables.
* Parametric panel-cut math via models/mrp_bom.py with NF14-documented
  geometric conventions (frameless euro construction; named constants
  swap when canonical specifications land).
* QWeb reports: Signature Spec Sheet (sale.order-bound, customer PDF),
  Shop Copy (mrp.production-bound, shop-floor companion), Door Order
  (sale.order-bound per-SO door schedule).
* The southbrook.order.analytics companion model captures channel,
  series, lifecycle timestamps, and BoM-rollup counts on every order
  confirm — the AI data spine for future forecast / quote / yield work.
* 212+ automated tests (post 2026-07-01 E2E audit) including a 10-step
  Phase-1 smoke gate, declarative rule-firing tests (Rules 2/3/4),
  per-channel pricelist math, and a Q7 per-line re-price assertion.

Dependencies
------------

This addon depends on the OCA product_configurator suite (product_configurator,
product_configurator_mrp, product_configurator_sale) which is NOT on the
Odoo Apps Store. Install from https://github.com/OCA/product-configurator
before installing this addon.

Phase scope
-----------

This is Phase 1 of a 4-phase build. The customer-facing one-page
configurator (Phase 2), the Three.js procedural 3D layer (Phase 3),
and the Accucutt cut-list bridge (Phase 4) ship in subsequent releases.

Documentation
-------------

See CHANGELOG.md for the release notes, README.md for the canonical
design-docs index, and PUNCHLIST.md for the locked-decisions trace
(referenced from every commit body by Q-number and NF-number).

    #      (all 6 point at pricelist_retail per the corrected PT-P1-03).
    #   2. demo_variants.xml — one product.product per cabinet template
    #      (the 12 templates use create_variant='dynamic' per Q6, so
    #      variants don't materialise automatically; demo_variants seeds
    #      a representative "default config" variant per template
    #      bypassing the Q6 dynamic-variant rule for demo purposes).
    #   3. demo_orders.xml — 6 quotes + 5 confirmed orders + the
    #      gate-walk-canonical PT-P1-01-reproducibility order, all
    #      referencing demo_variant_* xml_ids from #2.
    #
    # NF22 (caught 2026-05-30) RESOLVED by PT-P1-01 demo XML
    # reproducibility (2026-05-31): the original `product.product_product_4`
    # references in demo_orders.xml were the blocker. Replaced with
    # demo_variant_* references from southbrook_demo_variants.xml.
    # Demo orders now install on a --without-demo DB without dependency
    # on Odoo core demo records.
    #
    # Phase 3 follow-up: replace demo_variants.xml with a Python-side
    # helper that walks the OCA product.config.session flow per cabinet,
    # materialises the variant with value_ids populated, and binds those
    # session-attached variants to the demo orders. That gives the BoM
    # rollup truly attribute-driven values (instead of _SKU_DEFAULTS
    # fallbacks). See PT-P1-01 layer 3 in PUNCHLIST.md.

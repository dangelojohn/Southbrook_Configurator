Southbrook Cabinet Installer
=============================

Foundation module for installation crew operations. Models the
installer job lifecycle from scheduled → invoiced through an 8-stage
state machine and an 11-phase per-job install log with photo-gated
phase completion.

CURRENTLY SHIPS (Phase 1.1 of v1 spec):

- ``southbrook.installer.stage`` — workflow stages with exit-gate
  conditions (delivery confirmed, all phases done, sign-off, closeout).
- ``southbrook.installer.phase`` — 11-phase template (site assessment,
  layout, uppers, bases, tall, fillers, doors, hardware, lighting,
  trim, punch-list prep).
- ``southbrook.installer.stage.log`` — per-job phase log with
  photo-gated completion, GPS, and duration tracking.
- ``southbrook.installer.job`` — the central job record. Inherits
  chatter and activity mixins. Auto-numbered via ``ir.sequence``
  (``INST-%(year)s-%(seq)05d``). On create, auto-spawns one
  stage_log per active phase.

GATE PHILOSOPHY:

  Gates are *exit conditions* on a stage. ``action_advance_stage()``
  collects ALL failing gates and surfaces them in a single
  ``UserError`` — the installer is never asked to submit ten times
  to discover ten different problems.

PLACEHOLDER FIELDS (wired in later phases):

- ``delivery_confirmed`` — flipped manually here; computed from
  ``southbrook.delivery.manifest`` in Phase 1.2.
- ``sign_request_ref`` — Char placeholder; replaced with a
  Many2one → sign.request in Phase 2.3 (sign module is not in
  this stack today).
- ``closeout_done`` — flipped manually here; computed from
  ``southbrook.installer.closeout`` in Phase 1.3.

SAFE DEPS ONLY:

  ``project`` for project_id, ``hr`` for installer/crew, ``stock``
  for kit_picking_id. ``sign`` and ``sms`` deliberately omitted;
  cold install must succeed in this stack as-is.

Southbrook QR Kit
=================

Foundation addon for all QR-driven workflows across Southbrook.
Provides:

- `southbrook.qr.payload` service — HMAC-SHA256 signed payloads of
  the form `sb://<kind>/<id>?t=<unix>&s=<hmac>`. The HMAC secret is
  stored in `ir.config_parameter` `southbrook.qr_kit.hmac_secret`
  (auto-generated on first use; 32 bytes urlsafe).
- `/sb/qr/scan` controller — single entry point for every QR scan.
  Resolves the kind to a registered handler, enforces ACL, logs the
  scan, returns JSON or HTML redirect depending on request.
- `southbrook.qr.scan.log` model — append-only audit of every scan.
- "Print QR Label" wizard — generic per-model QWeb report renderer.
- "Recent Scans" tile pattern for dashboards.

KIND REGISTRY:

  Other addons register their kinds via subclassing `QrKindHandler`:

      class AsbuiltKind(models.AbstractModel):
          _name = "southbrook.qr.kind.asbuilt"
          _inherit = "southbrook.qr.kind"
          _kind_name = "asbuilt"
          _target_model = "southbrook.asbuilt"
          _default_action = "open"

  This file pulls them from the registry — no central kind list.

SECURITY:

  HMAC is the forgery defense, not a permission gate. ACL on the
  target model is still enforced. A malicious actor with a stolen
  secret could still only do what their Odoo user is allowed to do.

  Optional `expires_in_seconds` per kind — handles "one-time use"
  receipts (e.g. ephemeral POD QRs that expire in 24h).

    # W035 (R8.14, 2026-06-27): hr depends added — scan log gains
    # `employee_id` and /sb/qr/identify resolves hr.employee.pin.
    # W071 (R8.10, 2026-06-27): mrp depends added — trolley QR kind
    # binds a pre-staged stock.picking (internal) to mrp.workorder via
    # the new x_sbk_trolley_id field; resolution code reads
    # employee_assigned_ids / operator_id from mrp.workorder.

    # W036 (R8.7, 2026-06-27) — scan-success/fail audio cues for the
    # tablet/handheld scan flow. Loads into web.assets_backend AND
    # web.assets_frontend so both backend OWL clients and any public
    # PWA scan UI emit the same beep. Self-installs by patching the
    # global fetch + XMLHttpRequest layers; default = unmuted.
    # W035 (R8.14, 2026-06-27) — operator PIN modal + top-bar badge
    # also bundled into BOTH backend and frontend so the operator
    # identity follows the kiosk regardless of which Odoo surface
    # the tablet happens to be on.
    # W038 (R8.5, 2026-06-27) — Night-shift dark mode. SCSS + toggle
    # JS bundled into BOTH backend and frontend so kanban, scan modal,
    # POD page, and traveler-print preview all honour the same body
    # class. Default OFF — day-shift users see zero visual change.
    # W037 (R8.4, 2026-06-27) — Offline scan queue: the SW glue
    # (`offline_scan_queue.js`) lives in the bundle so it
    # auto-registers on every page; the SW itself (`offline_scan_sw.js`)
    # is NOT bundled — it's served by the `/sb/qr/sw.js` route at
    # top-level scope so the browser grants it `/sb/qr/*` scope.

        # W073 (R8.8, 2026-06-27) — Floor companion UI (Bin Scan +

        # mount element, so the boot is a no-op on every other page

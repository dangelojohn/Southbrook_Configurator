"""mrp.bom extension for Southbrook PLM.

Two concerns:

1. **Versioning** — adds ``southbrook_version`` so an ECO of kind 'bom' can
   copy a template BoM to a new version and archive the prior one
   (southbrook.eco._apply_bom).

2. **The cut-spec seam override** — ``southbrook_estimating`` reads its NF14
   geometric constants through ``_get_cut_constants()`` (a seam it defines so
   it can run standalone, returning the code defaults). This module overrides
   that seam to return the *active* ``southbrook.cut.spec`` instead, so the
   panel-cut math is driven by ECO-approved data rather than module constants.
   When no active spec exists, we defer to ``super()`` (the code defaults), so
   installing this module never silently changes cut output until a spec is
   activated.

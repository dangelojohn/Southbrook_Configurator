Southbrook Central Command
===========================

Leaf aggregation node — reads from every Southbrook production/quality/
delivery module and native purchase/stock, and adds exactly one new model
(`southbrook.command.exception`) plus a read-time scoring library
(`southbrook.command.center`, an AbstractModel — zero stored fields, zero
`@api.depends` across foreign models). Supersedes the
`southbrook.kitchen.ops.dashboard` TransientModel POC's dashboard menu entry
in `southbrook_premium_orchestration` (that module's other responsibilities —
ops event authoring, readiness/MI orchestration — are untouched).

Writes to exactly two places: its own `southbrook.command.exception` records,
and new `southbrook.hermes.recommendation` records when an action requires an
agent-authored proposal. Never writes to project.task, sale.order,
mrp.production, southbrook.mi.check, southbrook.cmms.breakdown_alert, or
southbrook.ncr.

See DELIVERABLE_1_ARCHITECTURE.md / DELIVERABLE_2_DATA_MODEL.md /
DELIVERABLE_3_SCORING.md / DELIVERABLE_8_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md for the full design
record this addon implements.

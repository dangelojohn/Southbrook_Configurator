Southbrook Manufacturing PM
===========================

Bridges the customer-facing Order Builder (southbrook_estimating +
southbrook_estimating_website) into Odoo's mrp + maintenance stack
so a Manufacturing PM (Marcus Chen persona) can convert confirmed
orders into manufacturing orders + work orders with real cycle
times, monitor floor load + equipment condition, and hand off to
Floor Managers.

Closes M1-M20 from the 2026-06-01 Manufacturing PM JTBD gap
analysis. Layered build:

  Layer 1 — Foundation (this addon's data + plumbing)
      M8  8 mrp.workcenter records for Southbrook stations
      M6  Standard routing template per cabinet family
      M9  Cycle-time defaults per (cabinet × station)
      M3  Send-to-Production action wired to mrp.production create
      M7  Order Builder → Work Order generation per line

  Layer 2 — PM surface (follow-up commits)
      M4  Ready-for-Production queue (Confirmed MOs by deadline)
      M1  PM dashboard (queue + load + alerts + late)
      M10 Cross-station KPI panel
      M19 Lead-time-extra surfaced on Order Builder

  Layer 3 — Floor Manager + edges (follow-up commits)
      M13 maintenance.equipment.condition selection field
      M14 Equipment → MO impact chain
      M16 Floor Manager portal route + tablet layout
      M17 Floor Manager access group
      M20 ECO → in-flight MO notification rule

Portal routes for the Southbrook Estimating Order Builder.

Track 2 commit 1 (2026-05-30) — Phase 2 charter amendment 1:
this is the SCAFFOLD route. Renders a portal page with the chrome,
breadcrumbs, sidebar, and an empty `<div id="order_builder_root">`
placeholder where commit 2 will mount the OWL `<OrderBuilder/>`
component tree.

The controller intentionally leaves the OWL bundle off the page in
this commit so we can verify the portal frame, auth, and routing
work cleanly before adding the JavaScript layer. Commit 2 adds the
OWL bundle to the manifest's assets section and switches this
template to inherit the bundle.

Route shape: `/my/southbrook/order-builder/<int:order_id>`
  Matches Odoo portal convention (`/my/...`) so portal-side menu
  hooks + breadcrumbs work without bespoke wiring.

Auth model: portal user; `partner_id.parent_id` chain identifies
the dealer. The controller verifies the order belongs to either
the logged-in partner OR the partner's parent (dealer org).

# G5 + G4 + G8 (customer-flow JTBD gap analysis 2026-06-01) — capture
# the visitor's project name at signup so we can label their first
# auto-created sale.order without forcing a second prompt.
#
# Pre-fix: signup asked only Name / Email / Password, the post-signup
# redirect went straight to /my, the user landed at a generic portal
# dashboard with a CTA card (G10) and no project label.
#
# Mechanism:
#   1. views/auth_template.xml adds a 'Project Name' input to
#      auth_signup.signup right after the Name field (G5).
#   2. SouthbrookAuthSignup below stashes that value into
#      request.session at the same point the stock signup controller
#      validates the form (so it survives the auth flip + redirect).
#   3. SouthbrookOrderBuilder.southbrook_order_builder_new pops the
#      session value and writes it to sale.order.client_order_ref —
#      Odoo's existing 'Customer Reference' field, perfect for free-
#      text project labels like 'Smith Kitchen Renovation'.

#
# The CUSTOMER-facing one-page configurator per CLAUDE.md §2.1.
# Three-pane layout per PRODBOARD_MANIFEST §8.1:
#   left  58 px tool rail
#   centre 394 px catalog pane (296×94 tile grid)
#   right flex viewport (Phase 3 mounts Three.js parametric carcass here;
#         Phase 2 ships the 2D-isometric SVG fallback at Tier 3 per the
#         four-tier image cascade per CLAUDE.md §4.5)
#
# This commit scaffolds:
#   - The /kitchen-planner route (portal-authed, website=True so the
#     site frame, theme, and breadcrumbs apply).
#   - The mount-point template with `id="kitchen_planner_root"` (mirrors
#     T2C1's pattern for the Order Builder — commit 2 here would mount
#     <KitchenPlanner/> OWL component into it).
#   - The three-pane SCSS layout grid + Southbrook token import.
#
# This commit does NOT yet ship:
#   - The OWL component tree (Phase 2 commit 2+).
#   - Catalog tile renderer (Phase 2 commit 3+).
#   - The 2D-isometric SVG layer (Phase 2 commit 4+).
#   - Live attribute → price wiring (Phase 2 commit 5+).
#   - "Request a Price" → sale.order.draft + portal email (Phase 2
#     commit 6+).
#   - The Three.js procedural 3D layer (Phase 3).
#
# Auth model: same `auth="user"` as the Order Builder route. The
# customer logs in as an Odoo portal user (light auth — name + email).
# No SSO yet; Phase 4 polish.

        #      currency as list_price), so display matches what the
        #      order line will round to at confirmation time.

    # Phase 2 commit 4 — session create + attribute discovery.
    #
    # User clicks a catalog tile → frontend posts to .../session/create
    # with the template id → backend creates a product.config.session
    # (the OCA configurator's per-user-config record) and returns:
    #
    #   { ok, session_id, template: {id, sku, name, family, list_price},
    #     attributes: [ {attribute_id, name, display_type,
    #                    values: [{value_id, name, price_extra,
    #                              html_color}, ...]}, ... ] }
    #
    # Attributes ARE the configurator decisions: series / box_material /
    # door_style / colour / hinge / etc. — the 11-attribute set per Q2.
    # Each value carries the OCA price_extra so P2C5 can sum them into
    # the live total.
    #
    # P2C4 does NOT yet:
    #   - Write a value selection to session.value_ids (P2C5)
    #   - Compute price from value_ids (P2C5)
    #   - Commit session → materialise variant → add to sale.order (P2C6)

    #   1. /line/<id>/attributes  — read shape: returns the product
    #      template's attribute_line_ids with current selection per
    #      attribute (or null when the variant has no value for that
    #      attribute, which is the case for lines added via the
    #      default-variant fast path in /add-line).
    #   2. /line/<id>/set-attribute — write: takes one (attribute_id,
    #      value_id) at a time. Resolves the new variant via Odoo's
    #      _get_variant_for_combination (or creates one for dynamic-
    #      variant templates). Stamps line.product_id and trips the
    #      Odoo onchange that recomputes price_unit/name. Returns the
    #      refreshed line shape so the OWL store can drop the
    #      response straight into state without a second fetch.
    #
    # Auth: piggybacks on _southbrook_resolve_line which walks the

Southbrook Room Capture
========================

A customer photographs a kitchen (1-5 photos); a vision-capable Claude
model (Sonnet 5) estimates room geometry (layout shape, walls, ceiling
height, constraints such as windows/sinks/appliances) from the photos.

The estimate is NEVER used to create records directly. It is
normalized and handed back to the frontend, which pre-fills the
EXISTING "Set Up Your Room" wizard (southbrook_estimating_website's
RoomSetupWizard) for mandatory human review. Every geometry value
still passes through southbrook.room.validate_geometry before
persistence, exactly as if a human had typed it in — this addon adds
no new persistence path for southbrook.room / .wall / .constraint.

Privacy (test-enforced): images are transient, request-scoped only.
This addon never writes image bytes to ir.attachment, the filestore,
or disk, and never logs image data. Images are downscaled server-side
before the AI call to control cost/tokens.

Components:
* southbrook.room.capture (AbstractModel) — validates/downscales
  images, builds the Anthropic Messages API request, calls it (or
  returns a mock estimate when southbrook_room_capture.use_mock is
  True, the default so cold installs and CI never touch the network),
  and normalizes the response defensively.
* controllers/main.py — one JSON-RPC route:
  POST /southbrook/api/order/<id>/room/analyze-photos.

Frontend (2026-07-04): a "Capture room from photos" / "Re-scan from
photos" entry point on the Order Builder's Room Setup tab, wired to
the endpoint above. A successful, high-enough-confidence estimate
pre-fills RoomSetupWizard (patched to detect the idless "AI prefill"
case and show a dismissible "review before saving" banner); any
failure or low-confidence-with-no-walls response opens the wizard
BLANK for manual entry — the AI output is never trusted to prefill
without that check. See static/src/js/room_capture.esm.js's top-of-
file comment for exactly which file owns which piece of the UI and
why (OrderBuilder's inline-template constraint pushed the button
markup itself into a small, documented, additive edit in
southbrook_estimating_website/static/src/js/portal_boot.esm.js).

QR part lookup (2026-07-04): a customer/estimator scans the Southbrook
QR printed on a physical cabinet's Floor-Traveler label; the frontend
decodes it client-side and POSTs the decoded string to
POST /southbrook/api/order/<id>/scan-part, which resolves it (via the
southbrook.qr.part AbstractModel) to its sb.production.package,
verifies the caller owns the sale order that package's line belongs
to, and returns customer-safe quote/product/spec details for display
in the Order Lines estimate. Read-only: no record is ever created, and
this never touches the shop-floor scan/work-order-advance path owned
by southbrook_floor_traveler.

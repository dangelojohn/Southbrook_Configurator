Southbrook Configurator UX v2
=============================

A UX redesign of the customer-facing product configurator page (the one
rendered at /shop/<cabinet-slug> by the OCA website_product_configurator
module). Replaces the default form layout with a two-pane responsive
design taken from southbrook-configurator-v2.html prototype:

  Left  (sticky)   live cabinet preview, summary card (price, weight,
                   auto-SKU, completion ring), and the primary Add-to-
                   Quote CTA.

  Right (scroll)   4 collapsible attribute groups with chip-style
                   selectors, conditional disable for rule-blocked
                   options, and inline price-delta hints per option.

  Top              breadcrumbs, page title, and a bulk-tools bar with
                   Template Layout (CSV download) + Import Product
                   (CSV preview + commit) workflows.

This module deliberately does NOT modify the OCA product_configurator
or website_product_configurator addons (per the project brief,
CLAUDE.md §3 "what you do not touch"). The visual redesign lands via
QWeb template inheritance and a separate JS/SCSS bundle — uninstall
this addon and the original configurator UI returns unchanged.

Phasing
-------

Phase 1 — Scaffold (THIS COMMIT)
    Layout, chip selectors, live recalc, validation rules driven by
    OPTIONS object hardcoded in the JS. Same behaviour as the
    prototype HTML. Mount-point guard so the new JS no-ops on pages
    without the v2 root div.

Phase 2 — Real data
    Replace the hardcoded OPTIONS object with values pulled from
    product.attribute / product.attribute.value records. Bind
    price_extra from product.template.attribute.value. Server-side
    price recalc via the existing config session controller.

Phase 3 — Conditional rules from data
    Move the disable-finish-when-melamine and custom-needs-signature
    rules from hardcoded JS into a rule-table data model
    (product.config.line domain rules are already there — surface
    them through a JSON endpoint).

Phase 4 — Bulk tools wired to Odoo
    Server-side xlsx template generation (xlsxwriter), CSV/xlsx
    import with row-level validation against the same rule table,
    preview modal + explicit commit gate, error-report download.

Phase 5 — Tests + a11y
    Tour test for the configurator flow, unit tests for the rule
    engine, ARIA roles on chip selectors and import modal,
    keyboard navigation.

/**
 * PR2/PR2.5/PR2.5a contract — persistence after reload.
 *   1. `_hydrateFromDesign` populates state.items from a mocked
 *      /load_design_lines and never calls /layout (the destructive-
 *      reopen bug PR2.5 fixed: /layout is a generator that would
 *      silently replace the saved fill).
 *   2. Fail-loud: a rejected load_design_lines sets `_hydrationFailed`
 *      and disables _saveDesign() (no /save RPC, danger notification).
 *   3. Param intake: props.action.params.design_id is read directly.
 *   4. URL-restore fallback: params.actionStack's frame is used to
 *      recover a design_id ONLY when its `model` is genuinely
 *      "southbrook.kitchen.design" with a numeric resId (model-gated —
 *      a "bare" reload whose preceding frame is some other model must
 *      NOT be treated as a design id).

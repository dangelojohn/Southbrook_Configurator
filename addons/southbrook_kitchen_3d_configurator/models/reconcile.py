"""Recommendation D — Sprint 1 reconciliation cron.

One-way mirror: `southbrook.kitchen.design(.line)` (source of truth in
Sprint 1) → `southbrook.room` + `southbrook.room.wall` +
`sale.order.line` (Rec D authoritative graph from Sprint 2 onward).

Runs every 5 minutes. Only touches designs whose write_date is newer
than the last successful run (stored in ir.config_parameter). Logs
divergence between design.estimated_price and the summed
sale.order line totals but does NOT auto-heal — flagged for manual
review during Sprint 1 to build confidence before Sprint 2 flips the
direction.

Sprint 2 will add the reverse cron; Sprint 3 will delete this cron
after retiring the design model.
